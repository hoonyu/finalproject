HCDE 310

Hi. This is my final project for HCDE 310.
I have built an interactive website where users can find if certain foods have caused adverse events based on the FDA API.

You can access to the API keys by following the instructions on this page:https://open.fda.gov/apis/authentication/
You need to simply click "Gey your API key".

Although my project has not been changed substantially, I would like to point on the fact that instead of focusing on allowing users to
categorize the food by the product name (It was actually impossible to implement due to how the API was formatted), I decided
to focus on allowing them to categorize on reactions and outcomes. Also, I allowed the users to explore more about
their symptoms by providing a link as well as simplifying down the searching process to improve usabilty.
